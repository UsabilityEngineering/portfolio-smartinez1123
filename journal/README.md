# WREC

As a Chico State student I use the WREC app in order to check when the gym is open, what events are going on, and most importantly, to generate the bar code that is needed to enter into the gym. 

When you first open the app it can be a bit overwheleming since you're immeditly faced with multiple different buttons. However, the UI is **learnable** since every button is clearly labled. The main buttons that I focus on are on "Member ID","Waver", and "Hours".

When you click on the "Member ID" button you're met with a login screen. Here is where you put in your Chico State username and password. After entering your credentials a barcode is generated, which you use in order to actually get into the gym. It's super easy to use and the only way to mess it up is if you don't put in the correct credentials. I do wish that there was some way to save your credentials because as it is right now, everytime you go to generate the bar code you have to put in your information everytime. However, if you try to do this before you've signed the waiver then you're going to get an error.

When you click on the "Hours" button you're taken to some more buttons that you can then click on to find the hours for that paticular facility. Since I go to the gym and sometimes the climing gym I just click on their respective buttons. Having the hours when something is open is a common **convention** I know exactly how these menus work and there's no confusion as to what I'm looking at.

Because of how easy it is to wrap my head around everything that I want to do for this app, my **mental model** matches the **conceptual model** of how interactions work. If I want to see what hours the climing gym is open I already have a pretty good idea of how to do that. If I want to generate my bar code, I know what I have to do.
