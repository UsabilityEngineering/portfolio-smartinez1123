# Sergio's Journal

As a Chico State student I use the WREC app in order to check when the gym is open, what events are going on, and most importantly, to generate the bar code that is needed to enter into the gym. 

When you first open the app it can be a bit overwheleming since you're immeditly faced with multiple different buttons. However, the UI is **learnable** since every button is clearly labled. The main buttons that I focus on are on "Member ID", "Waver", and "Hours".

When you click on the "Member ID" button you're met with a login screen. Here is where you put in your Chico State username and password. After entering your credentials a barcode is generated, which you use in order to actually get into the gym. However, if you try to do this before you've signed the waiver then you're going to get an error.
